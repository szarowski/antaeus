## Antaeus

Antaeus (/ænˈtiːəs/), in Greek mythology, a giant of Libya, the son of the sea god Poseidon and the Earth goddess Gaia. He compelled all strangers who were passing through the country to wrestle with him. Whenever Antaeus touched the Earth (his mother), his strength was renewed, so that even if thrown to the ground, he was invincible. Heracles, in combat with him, discovered the source of his strength and, lifting him up from Earth, crushed him to death.

Welcome to our challenge.

## The challenge

As most "Software as a Service" (SaaS) companies, Pleo needs to charge a subscription fee every month. Our database contains a few invoices for the different markets in which we operate. Your task is to build the logic that will schedule payment of those invoices on the first of the month. While this may seem simple, there is space for some decisions to be taken and you will be expected to justify them.

## Instructions

Fork this repo with your solution. Ideally, we'd like to see your progression through commits, and don't forget to update the README.md to explain your thought process.

Please let us know how long the challenge takes you. We're not looking for how speedy or lengthy you are. It's just really to give us a clearer idea of what you've produced in the time you decided to take. Feel free to go as big or as small as you want.

## Developing

Requirements:
- \>= Java 11 environment

Open the project using your favorite text editor. If you are using IntelliJ, you can open the `build.gradle.kts` file and it is gonna setup the project in the IDE for you.

### Building

```
./gradlew build
```

### Running

There are 2 options for running Anteus. You either need libsqlite3 or docker. Docker is easier but requires some docker knowledge. We do recommend docker though.

*Running Natively*

Native java with sqlite (requires libsqlite3):

If you use homebrew on MacOS `brew install sqlite`.

```
./gradlew run
```

*Running through docker*

Install docker for your platform

```
docker build -t antaeus
docker run antaeus
```

### App Structure
The code given is structured as follows. Feel free however to modify the structure to fit your needs.
```
├── buildSrc
|  | gradle build scripts and project wide dependency declarations
|  └ src/main/kotlin/utils.kt 
|      Dependencies
|
├── pleo-antaeus-app
|       main() & initialization
|
├── pleo-antaeus-core
|       This is probably where you will introduce most of your new code.
|       Pay attention to the PaymentProvider and BillingService class.
|
├── pleo-antaeus-data
|       Module interfacing with the database. Contains the database 
|       models, mappings and access layer.
|
├── pleo-antaeus-models
|       Definition of the Internal and API models used throughout the
|       application.
|
└── pleo-antaeus-rest
        Entry point for HTTP REST API. This is where the routes are defined.
```

### Challenge Progress Log

* First (probably an hour) I realised that I am not sure about the challenge goal. So this is my current status 
of the exploration.

* There is an external payment provider which should do the `charge` task but the mock in the app module is randomly 
generating the results and no exceptions. I assumed that the external service is not the code I can change so I left the mock as is.

* However, I could change the billing service as it seems to be an internal service. The code is in BillingService.kt
  
* The next issue to resolve was to schedule billing at the first day of every month.
I updated it in the AntaeusApp.kt file. It is a simple thread scheduling when every day we check if it is the first day
of the month and if so, we trigger the billing, it prints some log otherwise.

* Finally it would be great to have some tests for BillingService, so I implemented them in BillingServiceTest file.

It took me about 2 hours ..so far.

#### Notes

BillingService duplicates (intentionally) PaymentProvider exception checks and adds a check 
to throw InvoiceNotFoundException because it is not clear to me how this external service can generate those exceptions
without access to the Customer model (which is internal).
